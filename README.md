Beat the deck is a semi-popular card game where 9 cards from a deck are dealt face up in a 3x3 grid. 
The player must select a card in the grid and declare whether the next card from the deck is higher or lower than their chosen card. 
If the player guesses correctly, the new card is placed on top of the old card, and the game continues. 
If the player guesses incorrectly, the new card is placed on top of the old card, and the pile is flipped upside down. 
This position in the 3x3 grid is no longer in play. 
If the player can correctly guess enough cards in order to complete the deck while still having at least one position in the grid face up, they win. 
If the player guesses incorrectly 9 times, thus resulting in each position in the grid to be face down, they lose. 

This project was based on a previous project of mine which was abandoned, consisting of simulations of the card game blackjack, where I attempted to calculate the efficiency of card counting through repeated simulations. 
By running the simulations file, you can adjust the number of simulations run, and find the approximate win percentage of the game. 

DISCLAIMER!!!
-------------
I am still unsure of whether this is the most effective strategy to most efficiently beat the deck, so take the simulations with a grain of salt. 

UPDATES
-------
02/07/2024 - First prototype uploaded. This prototype only contains the text game, and while functionality is in working order, the code is inefficient and not properly structured. An updated version will be released shortly.
